# Watch

## Purpose

Thin GitHub WATCH poll ingress: Octokit/fixture search → allowlist gate →
session stub for mention / issue_comment / review_request / assignment on
allowlisted targets (ALLOW-1). Assignment when watch username is in issue/PR
assignees (#48). Poll-first for bot/VM; webhook deferred. Reliability harden:
per-cycle poll logging, caught pollOnce errors, auto-ack GitHub comment on
mention/comment start/continue (skip own username; once per event id), ignore
own mentions in search, document org-search pagination bury risk.

## Public API

loadWatchConfig, startWatchPoller, routeEvent, SessionStore, goLiveChecklist,
NOT_AUTHORIZED, filterNewEvents, containsMention, DetectedEvent types,
agent helpers, createFixtureSearchClient / createOctokitSearchClient,
ack helpers (shouldAckEvent, buildAckBody, AckClient, AckedIdStore).

## Invariants

Empty github orgs+repos fail-start; empty users = deny-all for triggers;
allowlist BEFORE session spawn; denied refuse quietly (no session); processed-id
dedup; no ProcessManager; no auto-merge; secrets out of repo; fixture tests
need no live webhook secrets; pollOnce errors logged not swallowed; own
watch-username comments/mentions skipped; auto-ack at most once per event id;
WATCH agent spawn clears `CORVIDINHO_ACTING_DISCORD_USER_ID` and sets
`CORVIDINHO_ACTING_IS_ADMIN=0` so GitHub runs never act as a Discord memory
user (REQ-watch-008).

## Behavioral Examples

Allowlisted mention or assignment→start_session; same repo#number→continue_session;
non-allowlisted user/repo→refuse quiet; duplicate id→skip; missing token /
empty repos refuse start cleanly; poll cycle logs six counters; mention/comment
start/continue posts ack unless sender is watch username or already acked;
own-username comment omitted from events.

## Error Cases

Missing token; missing mention username; empty repo allowlist; not authorized
(user/repo); already processed.

## Dependencies

src/allowlist/github.ts, @octokit/rest (live), agent `task run` with the verify gate on (never --no-verify, #85).

## Change Log
