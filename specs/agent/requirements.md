# Agent — requirements

See agent.spec.md REQ-agent-001..003 via SpecSync change deltas.

### REQ-agent-001

The system SHALL expose task states idle, planning, executing, verifying, done, and failed (AGENT-8).

Acceptance Criteria
- `runTask` emits `StateChanged` for planning → executing → verifying → done|failed.
- `TaskResult` includes `state` reflecting the terminal state.

### REQ-agent-002

When `verify_before_complete` is enabled and the execute step reports files changed, completion SHALL run `fledge lanes run verify --non-interactive`. Pass → `verified=true`. Fail with retries remaining → re-enter executing with verifier output. Exhausted retries → terminal failure with `verified=false` (AGENT-4 / AGENT-4.a / FLEDGE-2).

Acceptance Criteria
- Mock verify fail then pass within max_retries yields `verified=true` and a second execute call that receives feedback.
- Exhausted retries yield `verified=false` and failed state.
- Default runner invokes fledge with `lanes run verify --non-interactive`.

### REQ-agent-003

`--no-verify` or config `verify_before_complete=false` SHALL skip the gate (`verify_skipped=true`). Cancellation via AbortSignal SHALL abort promptly (AGENT-3).

Acceptance Criteria
- Skip path never calls verify runner; `verified=false`, `verify_skipped=true`.
- Aborted signal during/before verify returns `cancelled=true`.
