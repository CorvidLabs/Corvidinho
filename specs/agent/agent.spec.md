# Agent

## Purpose

Agent execute tool-loop also carries MEMORY instructions (AGENT-7 / MEMORY-2/4)
so Discord/CLI chats trust injected facts and call memory-store/recall
appropriately (REQ-agent-010).

## Public API

Export `MEMORY_AGENT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS` from `src/agent/execute.ts` (and
`src/agent/index.ts`).

NDJSON event stream (REQ-agent-073, issue #73): `src/agent/events-ndjson.ts`
owns `CORVIDINHO_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (2) and exports `frameFromEvent`,
`usageFrame`, `resultFrame`, `serializeFrame`, `createNdjsonWriter`,
`summarizeToolArgs`, `parseNdjsonLine`, `createNdjsonParser`,
`readNdjsonStream`, `progressFromFrame`, `collectTaskRunStream`. Frames:
`{protocol, type}` with AgentEvent types `StateChanged` / `Text` / `ToolCall`
(`name`, `argsSummary`) / `ToolResult` / `VerifyResult`, plus `usage`
(running prompt / completion / total tokens) and a final `result`
(`TaskResult`). `createTaskExecute({ onUsage })` reports running provider
totals; `extractUsage` reads OpenAI-compatible `usage`.

Daily spend cap (REQ-agent-098, issue #98, SAFE-8 as amended / AUTONOMOUS-8):
`src/agent/spend.ts` exports `SPEND_CAP_ENV`
(`CORVIDINHO_DAILY_SPEND_CAP_USD`), `SPEND_WINDOW_MS` (rolling 24 h),
`SPEND_WARN_PERCENT` (80), `MODEL_PRICES_USD_PER_MTOK`, `priceForModel`,
`parseSpendCap`, `costMicroUsd`, `estimateCallMicroUsd`, `formatUsd`,
`ensureSpendLedger`, `SpendLedger` (`reserve` / `settle` / `window` /
`noteWarning` over the module-owned `spend_ledger` and `spend_alerts` tables
in the shared DB), `SpendCapRefusal` (carries a `spend-cap` `HumanAsk`),
`createSpendGuard` (`{ fetch, finish }`: the capped provider fetch plus the
hook that turns a stopped call into the attempt's ask), `withSpendCap` (the
fetch alone; unchanged when no cap is set), `readSpendSnapshot` and
`spendDoctorCheck` (doctor line). `src/agent/spend-notice.ts` holds the
pure text: `formatSpendWarningLine`, `spendWarningFromUnknown`, the
`spendCap*Ask` question builders, `formatSpendDoctorLine`,
`formatSpendStatusLine` (Discord `/status`) and `spendPercent`.
`createTaskExecute` builds its fetch with `createSpendGuard`, emits the 80%
warning as a `Text` event and through `onSpendWarning`, and passes every
attempt's result through `finish`. `HumanAskReason` gains `spend-cap`;
`TaskResult` gains optional `spendWarning` (`SpendWarning`: integer
`spentMicroUsd` / `capMicroUsd` and `percent`).
Project instructions (REQ-agent-084, AGENT-1, issue #84):
`src/agent/project-instructions.ts` exports `findProjectRoot`,
`loadProjectInstructions`, `renderProjectInstructions`,
`describeProjectInstructions`, `withProjectInstructions`,
`PROJECT_INSTRUCTION_FILES` (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`),
`PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS_MAX_BYTES` (16 KiB), `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS_HEADER`,
`NOT_COMMITTED_REASON` and `projectInstructionsWarning`
(re-exported from `src/agent/index.ts`). `createTaskExecute` loads them from
`cwd` by default; `projectInstructions: false` opts out.
`ProjectInstructions.source` is `commit` when the project root holds `.git`
(files are read from the `HEAD` commit through read-only git: `ls-tree`,
`cat-file`, `diff --name-only`, hooks and fsmonitor off, env clamped with the
git plugins' `gitEnv`) and `working-tree` otherwise. A loaded file carries
`uncommitted: true` when its working-tree copy differs from `HEAD`.

Ask the human (REQ-agent-044, issue #44, AUTONOMY-1/2): `src/agent/ask.ts`
exports `ASK_TOOL_NAME` (`ask-human`), `withAskTool`, `askFromToolArguments`,
`askFromUnknown`, `formatAskSummary`, `stuckAfterVerifyAsk`,
`ASK_AGENT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS`. `AgentState` gains `blocked`;
`ExecuteResult` / `TaskResult` gain optional `ask: { reason: "clarify" |
"stuck", question }`. A clarify ask ends the run `blocked` (verify skipped,
exit 0); verify exhaustion stays `failed` and carries a `stuck` ask. Additive
on the NDJSON wire: protocol stays 2.

## Invariants

Tool-loop system prompt SHALL include trust-inject / memory-store /
memory-recall-before-ignorance / never-invent rules. OpenAI tool argv
descriptions for `memory-*` commands SHALL include concrete examples.

NDJSON frames never carry raw tool arguments; ToolCall `argsSummary`, Text,
ToolResult detail and VerifyResult output are SAFE-6 scrubbed and capped.
AgentEvent stays frozen (usage is a separate callback), so `task run --json`
events are unchanged.

No spend cap set means no spend behavior: the fetch is untouched and the DB is
not opened. With a cap, a provider call is never sent unless its estimate was
reserved under the cap in one IMMEDIATE transaction. A call that would pass
the cap, and every call while the model is unpriced, the cap value is invalid
or the ledger is unavailable, is not sent: the attempt ends with a
`spend-cap` ask and the run is `blocked` (never `done`, never retried, verify
skipped) — the runner never spends past the cap and never counts an unpriced
model as free. The 80% warning is recorded at most once per cap value per
rolling 24 h across processes (`spend_alerts`, same IMMEDIATE transaction as
its check). Money is integer micro-USD, rounded up.
Project instructions come only from the project root (nearest `.git` at or
above cwd, else cwd), never from a parent directory above it. Each file is
capped at 16 KiB with a truncation marker, SAFE-6 scrubbed, and labelled as
project instructions that cannot widen SAFE-1 consent, the tool allowlist or
the capability tier. The loader never throws.

In a git project only the `HEAD` copy of an instruction file reaches the
system prompt. The file tools (files-write / files-edit, not dangerous) can
change the working tree without consent, so working-tree edits and untracked
instruction files are never loaded; only a commit, which needs a dangerous,
consented tool such as `git-commit` (SAFE-1), changes what later runs see. A
`.git` that git cannot read never falls back to the working tree. Committed
symlinks are followed only as paths inside the commit, never through the
filesystem.

`buildOpenAiTools` omits mutating plugins when `actingIsAdmin` is false (ROLES-CHAT-2); `createTaskExecute` resolves ADMIN from env via `resolveActingIsAdmin` when a role session is active.

`ask-human` is intercepted by the tool loop (never dispatched as a plugin) and
is offered only on tool/code tiers. A run with an ask is never `done`; the
question is capped at 1500 chars and an empty question is refused back to the
model.

## Behavioral Examples

### Scenario: System prompt mentions memory-store

- **Given** tool-loop execute is constructed
- **When** the system message is built
- **Then** it embeds MEMORY_AGENT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS with argv example for
  memory-store

## Error Cases

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Verify exhausted | state failed, verified=false, summary includes verifier output, `ask` reason stuck |
| Model calls ask-human | state blocked, verifySkipped=true, `ask` reason clarify, summary `Needs your input: …` |
| ask-human with empty question | ToolResult success=false fed back to the model; loop continues |
| AbortSignal fired | cancelled=true (outer loop) or execute returns early mid tool loop |
| fledge missing | verify failure output names PATH miss |
| SpecSync registry missing | Planning soft-fails; execute continues |
| Dangerous plugin + non-interactive + not allowlisted | ToolResult success=false (SAFE-1); loop may continue |
| Spend cap set and 24h spend + estimate over it, unpriced model, invalid cap value, or ledger unavailable | provider call not sent; run ends `blocked` with a `spend-cap` ask stating spend vs cap and how to continue (SAFE-8) |
| Settled call brings 24h spend to ≥80% of the cap for the first time in 24h | one `Text` warning + `TaskResult.spendWarning`; later calls stay quiet (SAFE-8) |
| AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md missing | skipped; system prompt unchanged |
| Instruction file symlink resolves outside the project | refused; named in a one-time Text note; run continues |
| Instruction file is a directory, binary, or not UTF-8 | refused; named in a one-time Text note; run continues |
| Instruction file over 16 KiB | first 16 KiB kept (UTF-8 boundary) plus truncation marker; one-time Text note |
| Git project: working-tree AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md differs from HEAD | HEAD copy loaded; one-time Text note says working-tree changes were not loaded |
| Git project: instruction file untracked, or HEAD unborn | refused as not committed; named in the Text note |
| Git project: `.git` unusable (not a repo top level, git missing) | present files refused; no working-tree fallback |
| Git project: committed symlink leaves the commit, is broken, hops a symlinked dir, or loops | refused; named in the Text note |

## Dependencies

Spawns `fledge` for the default verify runner. Reads SpecSync registry/specs via plugin helpers. Dispatches allowlisted plugins via `runPlugin` during the LLM tool loop. No Trust/attest.
