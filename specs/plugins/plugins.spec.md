# Plugins

## Purpose

Plugin host includes Discord outbound post, GitHub write plugins as dangerous
(GITHUB-2/3/5), memory-store/recall/forget/override (MEMORY / REQ-plugins-010),
and file/search plugins (`files-read|write|edit|glob|list|delete`, `search-grep`)
with SAFE-2 protected-path guards (PLUGIN-1/2 / REQ-plugins-081..084), and
typed git plugins (`git-status|diff|log|branch-list` reads;
`git-branch-create|commit|push` dangerous code-tier mutators) clamped to the
task worktree (PLUGIN-1/2, SAFE-1/2/3, GITHUB-2/6 / REQ-plugins-182).

## Public API

Export allowlist load + github/discord gate helpers used by plugins and future
HEAR. File/search plugins register via `loadFilesPlugins` / `loadSearchPlugins`;
git plugins via `loadGitPlugins` (`plugins/git/index.ts`).

## Invariants

Builtin plugin loaders MAY re-register after an in-process registry clear
(test seam). Presence of an already-registered command name skips duplicate
register. GitHub write commands (`github-issue-create`, `github-issue-comment`,
`github-pr-create`, `github-pr-review`) are dangerous + minTier 1; SAFE-1
non-interactive deny unless CORVIDINHO_ALLOWLIST names them. Repo gate
(GITHUB-6 / ALLOW-1) still applies before any Octokit write. PR create appends
plain Made with Corvidinho attribution (no @handles). Dry-run via
CORVIDINHO_GITHUB_DRY_RUN=1. File write/edit/delete require minTier 2 (code);
`files-delete` is dangerous. Paths clamp to plugin cwd; symlink escapes refuse.
Protected infra (`.env*`, `.git`, `fledge.toml`, `specs/**` / `*.spec.md`,
keystore basenames) cannot be overwritten or deleted via file tools (SAFE-2);
no in-band override. Memory plugins take the acting user and ADMIN
only from bridge-set env (`CORVIDINHO_ACTING_DISCORD_USER_ID` /
`CORVIDINHO_ACTING_IS_ADMIN`), never argv — `--user` / `--admin` / `--db` are
refused; ADMIN is re-checked in the handler (empty admin lists ⇒ nobody);
`memory-forget` / `memory-override` are two-phase with an HMAC confirm token
confirmed from a different turn (SAFE-4 / REQ-plugins-011).
Memory plugin command descriptions SHALL include concrete argv examples so the
LLM tool loop can call them (REQ-plugins-085). OpenAI tool schema argv text for
`memory-*` is enriched similarly in `buildOpenAiTools`.
Git plugins (REQ-plugins-182) spawn `git` with argv arrays only (no shell),
stdin closed, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, hooks disabled, repo-locating env
stripped and `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` at the cwd's parent; the plugin cwd
must be the repository / worktree top level (SAFE-3). Flags are strict
(unknown refused); path args use the files-plugin clamp and go after `--` as
literal pathspecs. Reads are `dangerous: false`, minTier 0. `git-branch-create`,
`git-commit` and `git-push` are dangerous + minTier 2. `git-commit` needs a
message, stages explicit file paths only (no directories / `--all` / amend),
commits only those paths (`--only`), refuses `.env*` / keystore / `.git`
paths and staging the deletion of SAFE-2 protected infra, and reports
`filesChanged`. `git-push` pushes only the current branch to the same-named
ref of a configured remote (never a URL), never forces, gates every push
URL's OWNER/REPO through `checkRepoGate` with the allowlist file + env
(GITHUB-6, deny wins), and redacts URL credentials / secret tokens. Draft
SAFE-22 default-branch policy is not enforced (awaiting HI).

## Behavioral Examples

### Scenario: memory-store description shows argv example

- **Given** builtins are loaded
- **When** an operator or the tool loop inspects `memory-store`
- **Then** the description includes `--category` / `person` / `identity` example argv

### Scenario: git-push refuses a repo off the allowlist

- **Given** the task worktree's `origin` points at OWNER/REPO not on the GitHub allowlist
- **When** the tool loop runs `git-push` (allowlisted as a dangerous command)
- **Then** the run fails with a GITHUB-6 error (exit 3) and nothing is pushed

## Error Cases

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Unknown plugin name | Throw / fail with Unknown plugin command |
| Dangerous + non-interactive + not allowlisted | Deny (exit 2) |
| Missing token / API fail on github-* | Clear error; non-zero exit |
| Dangerous github write + non-interactive + not allowlisted | Deny (exit 2, SAFE-1) |
| github write + empty/missing repo allowlist | Refuse (exit 3, GITHUB-6) |
| Path escapes project cwd / symlink escape | Refuse (exit 1) |
| Write/edit/delete protected infra | Refuse (exit 2, SAFE-2); no override |
| git plugin cwd not a repo top level | Refuse (exit 2, SAFE-3) |
| git-commit stages protected delete / `.env*` / keystore / `.git` | Refuse (exit 2) |
| git force / amend / `--all` / refspec / other-branch push | Refuse (exit 2) |
| git-push remote OWNER/REPO not allowlisted or denied | Refuse (exit 3, GITHUB-6) |
| git-push non-fast-forward | Fail (exit 1); never retried with force |
