## User Stories

- As Leif, I @mention the bot in an allowlisted Discord channel and get a real session stub on my Linux host (DISCORD-1).
- As a user, replies and thread messages continue the same session without hunting for an id (DISCORD-2 / 2.a).
- As an operator, non-allowlisted channels are refused; empty channel lists refuse start (DISCORD-5; default-deny).
- As a user, while the agent thinks I see a live status (time, tool, rough tokens) instead of a silent void (DISCORD-3).
- As an operator, slash commands let me manage sessions, see agents, check status, and drive work tasks without leaving Discord (DISCORD-4).

## Acceptance Criteria

### REQ-discord-001

The system SHALL start a session stub with a stable session id when the bot is @mentioned in an allowlisted channel (DISCORD-1). The stub MAY spawn `corvidinho task run --no-verify` (or echo); it SHALL NOT port ProcessManager.

Acceptance Criteria
- `routeMessage` on mention in allowed channel returns `kind: "start_session"` with new session id.
- Session stub recorded in SessionStore; no ProcessManager.

### REQ-discord-002

The system SHALL continue the same session id when a user replies to a bot message (DISCORD-2). Inside a Discord thread the system SHALL keep one session id for that thread (DISCORD-2.a).

Acceptance Criteria
- Reply referencing a tracked bot message resumes that session id.
- Thread id map keeps one session per thread.

### REQ-discord-003

The system SHALL only listen and post in allowlisted channels; messages in other channels SHALL be refused quietly or with a short not-authorized reply (DISCORD-5). Checks SHALL use existing `src/allowlist/` Discord helpers where empty channel/user/role lists mean deny-all.

Acceptance Criteria
- Non-allowlisted channel → `kind: "refuse"` / not authorized; no session created.
- `loadBridgeConfig` errors when channels list empty.

### REQ-discord-004

The bridge SHALL load allowlists from file and env. It SHALL require a non-empty channel allowlist and SHALL fail to start if the channel list is empty.

Acceptance Criteria
- DISCORD_CHANNEL_IDS and/or file/env channels union; empty → empty_channels error.

### REQ-discord-005

When DISCORD_TOKEN and DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN are both missing, the CLI/doctor/bridge SHALL explain the requirement and exit cleanly without crashing. Secrets SHALL never be committed to the repo.

Acceptance Criteria
- `corvidinho discord bridge` without token exits non-zero naming DISCORD_TOKEN / DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN and go-live checklist.

### REQ-discord-006

The bridge SHALL check wire protocol version against `corvidinho --protocol-version` (DISCORD-10 light): hard-fail on a verifiable mismatch; soft-continue if unverifiable.

Acceptance Criteria
- `corvidinho --protocol-version` prints `1`.
- Verifiable mismatch refuses start.

### REQ-discord-007

The system SHALL register `discord-post-message` as a dangerous plugin (externally visible write). Non-interactive runs SHALL deny it unless allowlisted (SAFE-1).

Acceptance Criteria
- `plugins list` shows dangerous=true.
- Non-interactive without allowlist → exit 2.


## Out of Scope

Soft later #13–14. No voice, Angular, AlgoChat, iced, ProcessManager, SQLite mute table.

### REQ-discord-008

While a session is running, the bridge SHALL show a live thinking status in the
channel (elapsed time, and when known: current tool and rough token use) by
posting one progress message and editing it in-place (DISCORD-3). The bridge
SHALL NOT leave a silent void for the duration of `agent.runChat`. Final agent
text SHALL still be posted as a separate reply after the progress message is
marked Done or error. The bridge SHALL NOT introduce ProcessManager.

Acceptance Criteria
- Session start/continue posts a progress embed (or equivalent) before awaiting agent completion.
- Progress edits include elapsed time; optional tool / token segments when provided.
- On success, progress marked Done then final reply posted; on failure, progress marked error.
- Fixture tests cover builders and edit sequence without live Discord token.
- Allowlists remain default-deny; no new secrets in repo.

### REQ-discord-009

The bridge SHALL register and dispatch thin slash commands `/session`,
`/status`, `/agents`, and `/work` so operators can manage sessions, see agents,
check status, and drive work tasks without leaving Discord (DISCORD-4). Handlers
SHALL re-check the channel allowlist at run time (DISCORD-5 / DISCORD-7 light).
Session start and work SHALL use SessionStore + in-memory work stubs +
AgentClient. The bridge SHALL NOT introduce ProcessManager or weaken allowlists.
Fixture tests SHALL cover dispatch and handlers without a live Discord token.

Acceptance Criteria
- Command bodies include session (list/start), status, agents, work.
- Non-allowlisted channel slash → not authorized; no session/work created.
- `/session list` reflects SessionStore; `/session start` creates stub + agent run.
- `/status` reports version/uptime/sessions/work/channels/protocol.
- `/agents` lists local Corvidinho agent; `/work` creates work stub + agent run.
- No ProcessManager; secrets out of repo; default-deny allowlists unchanged.

### REQ-discord-010

The bridge SHALL apply per-user sliding-window rate limits and an in-memory
mute set so one user cannot melt the box without punishing everyone else
(DISCORD-6). Rate limit and mute checks SHALL run on mention/reply/thread
continue and on slash dispatch after the channel allowlist gate. Optional
`rateLimitByLevel` SHALL override max messages for a numeric permission level
when provided. Mute seed MAY load from env; mute/unmute helpers mutate the
in-memory set (no SQLite in this thin slice). The bridge SHALL NOT introduce
ProcessManager or weaken allowlists. Fixture tests SHALL cover per-user
independence without a live Discord token.

Acceptance Criteria
- Default window 60s / max 10; env override for window/max + muted seed.
- User A rate-limited or muted → refuse A; user B still served.
- `rateLimitByLevel` override applies when permLevel provided.
- Mention/reply/thread continue and slash share the same per-user limits/mutes.
- No ProcessManager; secrets out of repo; default-deny allowlists unchanged.
