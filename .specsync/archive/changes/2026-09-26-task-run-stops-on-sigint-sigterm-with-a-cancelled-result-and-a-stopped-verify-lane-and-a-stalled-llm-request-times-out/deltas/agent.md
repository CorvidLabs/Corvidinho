# Delta — agent (an abort stops the verify lane; a stalled LLM request times out; agent-loop-4)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-244

An abort SHALL stop the run's work, not only its bookkeeping (AGENT-3):

- The default verify runner SHALL run `fledge lanes run verify
  --non-interactive` in its own process group and, when the run's
  AbortSignal fires, SHALL stop the lane's whole process tree (fledge and
  the lane tasks it started, REQ-plugins-154), so no verify step keeps
  running in the background. An already-aborted signal SHALL NOT start the
  lane. The lane SHALL also be stopped when this process exits or dies of a
  SIGINT / SIGTERM / SIGHUP it does not handle.
- `runTask` SHALL return the cancelled result (`cancelled=true`,
  `verified=false`, state `failed`) when the signal aborted while the verify
  lane ran, whatever exit the stopped lane reports and however many retries
  remain: no `VerifyResult`, no retry and no `stuck` ask.
- Each OpenAI-compatible chat completions request of `createTaskExecute`
  (tool loop and read tier) SHALL be bounded by a per-request timeout,
  covering both the wait for headers and the body read (default
  `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, 10 minutes; `llmTimeoutMs` option). A request
  that times out SHALL end the attempt with the summary `LLM request timed
  out after <ms>ms` instead of waiting forever; a caller abort SHALL still
  end the request at once and SHALL NOT be reported as a timeout. No
  environment variable is added.

Acceptance Criteria
- A provider that sends headers and then trickles body bytes forever makes a read-tier execute return `LLM request timed out after 300ms` within seconds (`llmTimeoutMs: 300`).
- A provider that never answers makes a tool-tier execute return `LLM request timed out after 200ms` after one request.
- A caller abort during a stalled request returns promptly with an `LLM request failed:` summary, not a timeout.
- A verify runner that sees the abort and returns a failed lane with `maxRetries: 0` yields `cancelled=true`, no `ask`, no `VerifyResult` event and one execute attempt.
- An interrupted `task run` stops a fake `fledge` and the lane task it started (REQ-cli-244).
