# Delta — agent (dispatch only offered tools)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-128

The LLM tool loop SHALL only dispatch tool calls whose name is in the catalog
offered for the current run (capability tier and danger filtered, AGENT-5).
Any other registered plugin name requested by the model SHALL be answered with
a refused tool result and SHALL NOT be executed, regardless of interactive
mode or allowlist (SAFE-1).

Acceptance Criteria
- A registered dangerous plugin not in the offered catalog is refused, not run, even interactive and allowlisted.
- Offered tools still run through `runPlugin` with SAFE-1 gating unchanged.
