# Delta — discord (open button asks keyed by askId, SESSION-MULTI-3)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-044

Sessions SHALL persist `pendingAsk` (including askId / expiresAt / optional
options). While set, a thin-ack continue SHALL restate the ask (stub+Choose
when options; formatAskReply when free-text) and SHALL NOT spawn the agent.
An explicit cancel SHALL clear pending ask. For free-text pending (no
options), a substantive continue SHALL clear pending and run the agent with
prior-question context. For button pending (has options), ordinary chat SHALL
continue the conversation WITHOUT clearing pending; only button pick, cancel,
or expiry SHALL clear it. Clarify asks SHALL mention the requester; stuck
asks SHALL mention the configured owner.

Pending asks SHALL be keyed by askId, not one per session (SESSION-MULTI-3).
When a later run of the same session asks again (a chat message sent while a
button ask is open, or the run a pick resumes), the new ask SHALL become the
session's `pendingAsk` (the one a thin-ack continue restates and a free-text
reply answers) and every earlier button ask SHALL stay open, so its Choose and
option buttons keep working until pressed or expired; a superseded free-text
ask is replaced. A button press SHALL be matched to the session's open ask
with that askId, whichever of its open asks it is. A pick, a late press or a
free-text answer SHALL clear only that ask, and the newest remaining open ask
that has not timed out SHALL become `pendingAsk` (earlier asks already past
their timeout are dropped then, never promoted, so a thin-ack continue never
restates expired buttons); an explicit cancel SHALL clear every open ask of
the session. Open asks SHALL persist in `discord_sessions.pending_ask` with
no schema change (one JSON object when one ask is open, as before; a JSON
array, oldest first, when several are) and reload with the session. No new
env var, config key, slash command, table or column.

A `/work` or `/session start` run that stopped with a clarify or stuck ask
SHALL store that ask as its session's free-text pending ask (the slash answer
shows it as free text, with no Choose buttons), and `/work` SHALL record the
task `blocked` (a stuck ask stays `failed`), never `completed`
(AUTONOMY-1). The slash answer message SHALL be bound to its session like a
chat reply (DISCORD-2), so a reply to it by the requester continues that
session and the rules above apply (AUTONOMY-5/6). A SAFE-8 spend-cap stop
SHALL NOT be stored as the pending ask.

Acceptance Criteria
- Clarify mentionUserIds is [requester] when provided; stuck is [owner].
- Thin ack restates; pendingAsk remains.
- Cancel clears pendingAsk.
- Free-text substantive continue clears pending and runs agent.
- Button pending survives unrelated chat turns until pick/cancel/expiry.
- `/work` with a clarify ask (even one with structured options): the task is `blocked`, the session's pending ask is the free-text clarify ask, and the collapsed answer message maps to that session.
- A thin reply (`ok`) to the `/work` answer restates the question (requester mention, reply hint) and does not run the agent; the pending ask remains.
- `cancel` in reply to the `/work` answer clears the pending ask with the short ack and does not run the agent.
- A substantive reply to the `/work` answer resumes the same session (`resume: true`) with the prior question and the human answer in the prompt, and clears the pending ask.
- `/work` or `/session start` stopped at the spend cap stores no pending ask; a later `ok` to the `/work` answer runs the agent with no prior-question or cap text.
- `/session start` with a clarify ask: the pending ask is stored; a thin reply restates, a substantive reply resumes with the question.
- `/session start` with a clarify ask that has structured options: the pending ask is free text (no options), so a substantive reply answers and clears it.
- `/work` with a stuck ask: the task is `failed`, the pending ask is stored; the owner is pinged once by the separate notice post (the answer itself pings nobody), and a thin reply restates the question with allowed mentions limited to the owner (never the requester).
- A reply to the `/work` answer by another user (`ok`, `cancel` or a substantive answer) neither runs the agent nor clears or restates the requester's pending ask (SESSION-MULTI-1).
- A finished `/work` run (`completed`) stores no pending ask and its answer still continues the session.
- Without an editable thinking message the pending ask is still stored, and an @mention `ok` from the requester restates it without running the agent.
- While Choose ask A is open, a chat message whose run asks again with Choose ask B makes B the pending ask and keeps A open: a thin reply restates B, A's Choose button opens A's choices, and a pick of A resumes the session with A's question and the chosen label while B stays pending; a re-press of A is a no-op; B's pick then resumes with B's question.
- While Choose ask A is open, a run that asks a free-text question F makes F the pending ask; a substantive reply answers F (prior-question context) and clears only F, so A is pending again and its buttons still resume the session.
- A late press on an earlier open ask gets `ASK_CHOICE_EXPIRED` and clears only that ask; the newer ask stays open.
- When the newest ask is picked while an earlier open ask has timed out, the earlier ask is dropped, not promoted: the session has no pending ask, a thin reply runs the agent, and a press on the dropped ask is a no-op.
- `cancel` with several open asks clears all of them with the short ack and no agent run; a later press on any of them is a no-op.
- `SessionStore`: one open ask persists as one JSON object; two persist as an array and reload as `pendingAsk` plus `openAsks` after a reopen; re-storing a held askId updates it in place; `findPendingAsk` finds an earlier open ask; clearing the newest promotes the earlier one; a new ask replaces a free-text ask but never a button ask; `null` clears all.
