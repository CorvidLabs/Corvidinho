# Agent semantic delta

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-260

The repository SHALL ship a root `agent.3md` that validates with
`@corvidlabs/agent3md` `validateAgent`, exposes guidance-only skill planes
(no `tool=` bindings that duplicate the SAFE plugin registry), and is covered
by a bun smoke that `route`s and `get`s at least one playbook. The agent loop
SHALL NOT load this file for progressive disclosure until AGENT-13 is HI'd
separately.

Acceptance Criteria

- `validateAgent(readFileSync("agent.3md")).ok` is true in CI/tests.
- Every skill in `Agent.manifest().skills` has `tool: null`.
- `Agent.route` + `Agent.get` resolve a named guidance playbook (e.g. `discord-ask`).
- `package.json` lists `@corvidlabs/agent3md` as a dependency.
