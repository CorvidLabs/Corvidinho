# Delta — discord (/work PR: owner-only, work branch only)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-088

After a `/work` run finishes, the handler SHALL try to ship the run's active
git worktree as a **draft** pull request (AUTONOMOUS-3 / GITHUB-2) and SHALL
add exactly one `PR:` line to its reply, above the run summary. A PR SHALL be
opened only when all of these hold, checked before any commit or push:

- the run finished cleanly and its result frame does not report a failed
  verify (AGENT-4);
- the work ran in an active git worktree with a branch, and that worktree has
  uncommitted changes or commits ahead of the merge-base with the remote
  default branch (`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, else `main`), with no conflicts;
- `git-push` and `github-pr-create` — plus `git-commit` when the tree is
  dirty — are in the non-interactive plugin allowlist (GITHUB-5 / SAFE-1);
- the push remote's OWNER/REPO passes the GitHub repo gate (GITHUB-6);
- the tree passed `fledge lanes run verify --non-interactive`: taken from the
  run's result frame when it reports `verified`, else run once in the worktree
  before anything is pushed (AGENT-4).

The steps SHALL run through the existing typed plugins with
`nonInteractive: true` — `git-commit` (explicit paths from `git status`),
`git-push`, then `github-pr-create --draft --head <talk branch> --base
<default branch>` — so SAFE-1 denial and SAFE-5 audit apply. The PR body
SHALL be built from the real diff against the merge-base (name-status file
list, diffstat, commit subjects) plus the verify result, with repo, model and
chat text inside code fences, and title, body and commit message SHALL be
secret-scrubbed (SAFE-6). The Discord spawn client SHALL pass the result
frame's `verified` / `verifySkipped` / `state` through as
`AgentSpawnResult.task`. When a gate fails or a step errors, the `PR:` line
SHALL say plainly why and SHALL NOT claim a PR. No new slash command, option,
env var, table or column.

Acceptance Criteria
- A dirty verified worktree with the three plugins allowlisted is committed, pushed and opened as a draft PR whose body lists the changed files, diffstat, commits and verify result.
- Missing allowlist entries are named in the reply and nothing is committed, pushed or verified.
- A failed run, failed verify, scoped (non-git) dir, clean tree, conflicts or repo-gate refusal opens no PR and says why in one line.
- An unverified run triggers one verify-lane run in the worktree before push; a failing lane ships nothing.
- Push or PR-create failure yields a plain line and never a claimed PR.
- Fixture tests use temp repos, a local bare remote, the dry-run github plugin and a mocked verify lane.
- A /work by anyone other than ADMIN (the owner) never runs the PR step (ROLES-CHAT-3); the reply says the changes stay on the work branch.
- Nothing is committed or pushed unless the worktree HEAD is the work branch and not the base; a switched or detached HEAD opens no PR.
