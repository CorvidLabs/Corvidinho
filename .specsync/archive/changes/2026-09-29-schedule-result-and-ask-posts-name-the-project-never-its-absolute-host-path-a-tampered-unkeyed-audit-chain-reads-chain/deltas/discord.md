# Delta: discord (schedule result and ask posts name the project, never its absolute host path — REQ-discord-353)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-353

A schedule SHALL NOT stop, or fail to start a run, silently (AUTONOMY-2:
"When stuck, it pings the configured owner on Discord rather than dying
silently"). Two schedule-run outcomes SHALL record a `stuck` ask on the
run's `schedule_runs` row, so the REQ-discord-347 ask post and delivery
pass ping the owner:

- Pre-run failure. A run whose project cannot be resolved (`project resolve
  failed: …`) or whose worktree cannot be created (`worktree failed: …`),
  including a step that throws instead of returning an error, SHALL still
  spawn no agent and be recorded failed with that full error,
  and SHALL record a stuck ask whose question is fixed text naming the step
  (`PROJECT_RESOLVE_FAILED_QUESTION`, `WORKTREE_FAILED_QUESTION`), never the
  host path or the error text (REQ-discord-418, SAFE-6), so a repeat of the
  same failure keeps one ping key.
- Auto-pause. The run whose failure makes `FAILURE_AUTO_PAUSE` (5) failures
  in a row, counted in SQL in the same run-finish transaction as today
  (REQ-discord-108), SHALL store the stuck `autoPauseAsk` in that same write
  instead of its own ask: `Paused after 5 failed runs in a row. Fix the
  cause, then resume it with /schedule resume.`, followed by a
  `Last failure: <question>` line when the run stopped with its own ask. The
  pause itself is unchanged (status `paused`, ping key cleared). A run that
  succeeds SHALL never store it.
- Delivery. A ticker that can post (the bridge) SHALL post such an ask of
  its own run at once through the in-process ask post of REQ-discord-347
  (live DISCORD-SCHEDULE-3 gate, compare-and-set take, schedule prefix, stuck
  headline, the owner mentioned, once per question per schedule through
  `askPingKey`); the pausing run's ask SHALL replace its plain `❌` post.
  When the pausing run had no ask of its own, the post's context SHALL be
  only what that `❌` post showed (`failed (exit N)`, the summary the run
  row keeps and the delivery pass posts), never the run's own output; a run
  that throws posts its pause ask at once with no context. An in-process
  post of the pause ask that does not go out (resolves `false` or throws)
  SHALL hand the ask back with no ping key kept, so a later delivery pass
  posts it: a paused schedule has no next run to post it. An ask a ticker
  with no outbound (the daemon) recorded SHALL be posted by the bridge's
  next delivery pass. `ScheduleRunFinished.askReason` SHALL be
  `stuck` for these runs, so the daemon logs `run.needs_human`
  (REQ-cli-098).
- Gate. A run the DISCORD-SCHEDULE-3 gate refuses (REQ-discord-020) SHALL
  still record no ask of its own and post nothing; when refused runs
  auto-pause the schedule, the pause ask SHALL stay pending until the gate
  passes, like any pending ask.

Every schedule post in the channel — the `✅` / `❌` result line and every
ask post, in-process or from the delivery pass, including the stuck asks
above — SHALL start with the schedule prefix
`Schedule **<name>** (<id>) on <project>`, where the project is shown by
name (`projectLabel`: the last segment of an absolute path, a relative name
as given), never as an absolute host path (REQ-discord-418, SAFE-6): the
whole channel reads it. The run row SHALL keep the full error and the
model's prompt SHALL keep the stored project.

No new slash command, env var, config key, table, column or schema version;
`/schedule resume` is the existing ADMIN subcommand.

Acceptance Criteria
- A daemon-claimed run that makes 5 failures in a row pauses the schedule and stores `ask_reason` `stuck` with the pause question and `ask_posted_at` null; `onRunFinished` reports `autoPaused: true` and `askReason: "stuck"`; the bridge's next tick posts it once with the schedule prefix, the stuck headline, the pause line, the `failed (exit 1)` context and `mentionUserIds` [owner]; the 4 earlier failures record no ask and post nothing.
- A stuck run that makes the 5th failure posts one ask: the pause line followed by `Last failure: <its question>`.
- A bridge-claimed run that makes the 5th failure posts the pause ask with the owner ping and the `failed (exit 1)` context (not the run's output) instead of the `❌` line (the 4 earlier ones post `❌` with no ping), records the ping key and is not posted again.
- A bridge-claimed pause ask whose post resolves `false` or throws stays pending with no ping key; the next tick posts it once with the owner ping.
- A bridge run that throws and makes the 5th failure posts the pause ask at once with the owner ping and without the error text.
- Refused runs that auto-pause the schedule spawn no agent and post nothing; once the creator is allowed again the next tick posts the pause ask with the owner ping.
- A daemon run whose project cannot be resolved spawns no agent, keeps `project resolve failed: …` (with the host path) on the row and stores the fixed question; the bridge posts it with the owner ping and without the host path; the same failure again posts without a ping.
- A bridge run whose worktree cannot be created keeps `worktree failed: …` on the row and posts the fixed question at once with the owner ping, once; so does one whose worktree step throws.
- The pause ask is chosen by the failure count in SQL: a store handle whose cache is stale stores it when SQL reaches 5; a success stores no ask and resets the count.
- A schedule whose project is an absolute host path posts its `✅` and `❌` result lines, its clarify and stuck asks (bridge-claimed and daemon-claimed) and its pre-run stuck ask (an absolute sibling project that cannot be resolved) with the project's name in the prefix and never the absolute path; the run row keeps `project resolve failed: …` with the path and the model's prompt keeps the stored project.
