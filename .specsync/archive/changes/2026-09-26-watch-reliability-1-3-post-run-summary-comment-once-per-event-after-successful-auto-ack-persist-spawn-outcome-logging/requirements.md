# Requirements

### REQ-watch-009

The system SHALL post a short agent summary comment on the same GitHub thread when the agent run finishes (success or failure), after a successful auto-ack on issue_comment or issues start_session or continue_session, at most once per event id, with Made with Corvidinho attribution (WATCH-RELIABILITY-1).

Acceptance Criteria
- Summary skipped when auto-ack did not succeed or event already summarized.
- Summary posted for both ok and non-zero exit runs.
- Fixture tests need no live GitHub token.

### REQ-watch-010

The system SHALL persist spawn outcome logging (start, exit code or error class, duration_ms) via a structured watch spawn log line and a durable JSONL store under the Corvidinho data dir (override CORVIDINHO_WATCH_SPAWN_LOG) readable without Discord (WATCH-RELIABILITY-2).

Acceptance Criteria
- Start and outcome log lines emitted per spawn.
- JSONL append contains eventId, exitCode, errorClass, durationMs.
- Fixture or temp-dir tests cover store without live Discord.

### REQ-watch-011

The system SHALL back off on GitHub 403 rate-limit (or 429) using Retry-After or x-ratelimit-reset headers, else a documented default of 60s, before the next poll cycle; SHALL NOT tight-loop; SHALL emit a clear watch github rate-limit backoff log line (WATCH-RELIABILITY-3).

Acceptance Criteria
- Retry-After seconds preferred; else reset; else 60s default.
- While backoff outstanding, pollOnce skips fetch.
- Plain 403 without rate-limit signal does not trigger backoff.
