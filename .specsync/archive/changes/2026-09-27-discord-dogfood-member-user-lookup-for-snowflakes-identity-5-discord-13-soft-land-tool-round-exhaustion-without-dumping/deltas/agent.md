# Delta — agent (soft-land + Discord chat prompt)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-312

When the LLM tool loop exhausts `maxToolRounds` without a final no-tool reply, execute SHALL soft-land (AGENT-9): `ExecuteResult.summary` SHALL be the last assistant prose when present, otherwise a short clarifying ask (e.g. "I'm not sure I have enough to answer that cleanly — can you clarify what you meant?"). The summary SHALL NOT contain the operator phrase `Stopped after N tool rounds`. An operator note with that phrase MAY be emitted as a `Text` event for thinking/NDJSON. `chatBodyFromTaskResult` SHALL strip any leftover `Stopped after N tool rounds` lines before Discord outbound (defense in depth).

The tool-loop system prompt SHALL include Discord chat discipline (IDENTITY-5 / DISCORD-13 / ROLES-CHAT-9): prefer conversational prose for social/game banter; call `discord-user-lookup` for snowflakes/@mentions/named members before repo tools; only use SpecSync/git/github/files when the query clearly needs Corvidinho codebase or product data; treat bare `bug <snowflake>` in Discord as a user id, not a GitHub issue.

Acceptance Criteria
- Exhausted rounds with no prose → clarify ask; no `Stopped after` in summary.
- Exhausted rounds with prior prose → that prose is the summary.
- Operator `Text` event may carry the stop note.
- `chatBodyFromTaskResult` drops stop lines.
- Fixture: `tests/agent.soft-land.test.ts`.
