# Delta — agent (the default catalog carries the read-only Fledge core builtins)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-112

When a task run's catalog may include dangerous tools (`includeDangerous`),
`createTaskExecute` SHALL load the project's Fledge plugins (cwd = task cwd,
env = run env) before building the tool catalog, so Fledge commands can be
offered and called as tools under the usual tier filter, catalog-only
dispatch and SAFE-1 allowlist (FLEDGE-4). The default catalog (dangerous
omitted) SHALL NOT spawn fledge. `buildOpenAiTools` SHALL build each tool with
the exported `toolDefForEntry`, which is also what the schema-cost view
measures (FLEDGE-5); the tool definitions sent are unchanged. The default
catalog SHALL offer no Fledge plugin command; the only `fledge-` tools in it
SHALL be the read-only Fledge core builtins `fledge-lanes-list` and
`fledge-lanes-validate` (PLUGIN-1, REQ-plugins-461), which spawn fledge only
when the model calls them.

Acceptance Criteria
- includeDangerous + code tier + allowlist: the first request offers `fledge-hello`; the model's call runs the fake fledge and the ToolResult succeeds with the plugin output.
- Default catalog: no Fledge plugin command (`fledge-<command>` from discovery, e.g. `fledge-hello`) is offered and none is registered; the only `fledge-` tools offered are the read-only Fledge core builtins `fledge-lanes-list` and `fledge-lanes-validate` (PLUGIN-1, REQ-plugins-461).
- Existing tool-loop tests pass unchanged.
- A default-catalog code-tier run with a fake fledge first on PATH offers `fledge-lanes-list` and `fledge-lanes-validate` and starts no fledge process (the fake records no call): the Fledge core builtins spawn fledge only when a tool call runs them.
