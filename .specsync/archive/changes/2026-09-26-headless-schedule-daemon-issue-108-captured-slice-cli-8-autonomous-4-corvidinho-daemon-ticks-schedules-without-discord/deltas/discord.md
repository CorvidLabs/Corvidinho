# Delta — discord (schedule ticks safe across processes)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-108

The Discord bridge and `corvidinho daemon` may tick schedules from one data
dir at the same time (CLI-8 / AUTONOMOUS-4). Schedule ticks SHALL then stay
correct:

- Each tick SHALL re-read the `schedules` table first, so schedules created,
  paused, resumed or deleted by another process are seen.
- Each due run SHALL be claimed with a compare-and-set on `status = 'active'`
  and the `next_run_at` the ticker saw. A run another ticker already claimed
  SHALL be skipped, so each due run fires exactly once.
- Store updates SHALL write only the columns they own. Status changes write
  status / next_run_at / updated_at; run start writes last_run_at /
  execution_count / next_run_at / updated_at; run finish writes
  consecutive_failures (counted in SQL) / updated_at. A run finishing in one
  process SHALL NOT undo a pause or resume made in another.
- The scheduler SHALL record each run's outcome exactly once, even when a
  shutdown abandons a run that later returns.

Existing tick behaviour is unchanged: the 60 s poll, max 2 concurrent runs,
no catch-up, auto-pause after 5 failures, and the non-blocking tick
(DISCORD-SCHEDULE-4). No schema change.

Acceptance Criteria
- Two tickers on one DB file start a due run once; one run row, `execution_count` 1.
- A tick sees create/pause/resume/delete made through another store handle.
- A pause made while a run is in flight survives that run finishing.
- Failures from two handles with stale caches still count to 2.
- `abandonInFlight` records a stuck run as failed once; a late agent result does not record it again.
