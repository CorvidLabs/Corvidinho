# Delta — cli (doctor warns on legacy admin lists)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-cli-042

`corvidinho doctor` SHALL report whether a durable owner is configured
(IDENTITY-1, CLI-4) from the same env and allowlist file the Discord bridge
reads (`CORVIDINHO_OWNER_*` env, allowlist `[owner]` section). The line SHALL
show "configured: yes" plus the display name when set, or "configured: no"
with a plain-language hint. It SHALL never print the owner's Discord id,
GitHub login, or any token. Owner config problems (for example a non-snowflake
Discord id) SHALL be named without echoing the value. A missing owner is
informational and SHALL NOT change the doctor exit code.

Because ADMIN is owner-only (IDENTITY-2), doctor SHALL print a
`[warn] admin-lists` line when `CORVIDINHO_DISCORD_ADMIN_USERS` or
`CORVIDINHO_DISCORD_ADMIN_ROLES` is set, saying they are ignored. The line
SHALL NOT echo their values and SHALL NOT change the exit code.

Acceptance Criteria
- Doctor prints an `owner` line with configured yes/no plus the display name only.
- Doctor never prints the owner Discord id, GitHub login, or tokens.
- A missing owner does not flip the doctor exit code.
- Legacy admin lists produce a `[warn] admin-lists` line without their values and without changing the exit code.
- Fixture test runs doctor with a temp allowlist file / env (no network).
