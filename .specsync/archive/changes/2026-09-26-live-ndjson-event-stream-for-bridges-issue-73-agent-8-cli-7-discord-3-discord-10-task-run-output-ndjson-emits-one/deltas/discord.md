# Delta — discord (live thinking status from the event stream, issue #73)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-073

The Discord spawn agent client SHALL run
`task run --no-verify --task <prompt> --output ndjson`, read stdout line by
line while the child runs, and forward each frame's live state, current tool,
and token counts to `onStatus` so the thinking embed shows what the agent is
doing (AGENT-8 / DISCORD-3). The reply summary SHALL come from the stream's
`result` frame; when no result frame parses, the client SHALL fall back to
`summarizeTaskRunOutput` over the non-frame stdout, stderr and exit code.
Frame-shaped lines that do not match the bridge's protocol (or are malformed)
SHALL never become reply text; when the binary streamed another protocol and
no result frame parsed, the reply SHALL be a protocol-mismatch notice naming
both versions.
Token counts SHALL be the provider-reported running total when a `usage`
frame arrived, else the existing rough estimate from the summary length.
Because the bridge now depends on the stream, `CORVIDINHO_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
SHALL be `2` and DISCORD-10 lockstep SHALL refuse a binary reporting another
version.

Acceptance Criteria
- Fake-bin fixture printing ndjson drives `onStatus` with planning / tool / token updates in order.
- Summary equals `summarizeTaskResult` of the result frame; garbage lines and stderr do not break parsing.
- Missing result frame falls back to `summarizeTaskRunOutput`.
- A protocol-3 frame's tool output never reaches the reply; the reply is the protocol-mismatch notice.
- Spawn argv ends with `--output ndjson` (no `--json`).
- `checkProtocolVersion` treats a protocol-1 binary as a mismatch; `--protocol-version` prints 2.

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-006

The bridge SHALL check wire protocol version against
`corvidinho --protocol-version` via Merlin-shaped `protocol-version.ts`
(DISCORD-10): hard-fail on a verifiable mismatch; soft-continue if
unverifiable. When the configured bin path ends in `.ts`, the probe SHALL
invoke via `bun` (never posix_spawn the `.ts` path alone — EACCES). Archive
`shared/bridge-protocol.ts` SHALL NOT be used.

Acceptance Criteria
- `corvidinho --protocol-version` prints `CORVIDINHO_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (currently `2`).
- Verifiable mismatch refuses start; unverifiable warns and continues.
- Fixture stub-binary tests cover match/mismatch/unverifiable/timeout.
- `.ts` bin probe uses argv starting with `bun` then the `.ts` path.
