# Delta — agent (AUTONOMOUS-1 gate + delegation core, #117)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-117

Autonomous mode SHALL be off until the project enables it in project config
(AUTONOMOUS-1). `src/autonomous/enabled.ts` SHALL read `<cwd>/fledge.toml` and
treat autonomous mode as enabled only when the key
`corvidinho.autonomous.enabled` (table `[corvidinho.autonomous]` or the dotted
key under `[corvidinho]`) is the literal `true`. A missing file, section or
key, any other value, an inline table, or a key under a later `[table]` /
`[[array]]` header SHALL be off.

The task-run tool loop SHALL offer autonomous extras (plugins declaring
`autonomous: true`, such as `delegate`) only when the session is allowed:
autonomous mode is enabled for the run's cwd and the delegation depth
(`CORVIDINHO_DELEGATE_DEPTH`; unset is 0, a malformed value is treated as the
cap) is below 2. Otherwise they SHALL be absent from the catalog at every tier
(SAFE-9), and a model naming them SHALL get the REQ-agent-128 refusal. The
loop SHALL pass its capability tier and abort signal to `runPlugin`.

The delegation core (`src/autonomous/delegate.ts`) SHALL run a worker as
`task run --non-interactive --tier <t> --output ndjson --task <text>`
through `buildCorvidinhoArgv` (so a `.ts` bin runs as `bun --no-env-file`), with
the `--task` value last and never `--no-verify` (REQ-cli-085): a worker keeps
the project's prove-before-done gate (AGENT-4) and reports its `verified` /
`verifySkipped` outcome. The worker bin SHALL be `CORVIDINHO_BIN` when set,
else this checkout's `src/cli.ts`, never the cwd's. The worker tier SHALL be
the requested tier clamped to the lead's; an omitted tier SHALL mean the
lead's tier and an unknown tier SHALL be refused. The worker env SHALL force
the depth to the lead's depth + 1, `CORVIDINHO_LLM_TIER` to the worker tier,
`CORVIDINHO_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`, `CORVIDINHO_ALLOWLIST` to the lead's effective
allowlist, `CORVIDINHO_ACTING_IS_ADMIN=0` and an empty
`CORVIDINHO_ACTING_CONFIRM_TOKENS`, overriding inherited values. At most 2
workers SHALL run at once and at most 4 SHALL start per lead process; beyond
that the call is refused, not queued. A worker SHALL be stopped on lead abort
(AGENT-3), after a 10 minute timeout, or when the lead process exits, and the
lead SHALL NOT wait on a worker pipe held open by a grandchild beyond a short
drain after the worker exits. The worker summary returned to the lead SHALL be
SAFE-6 scrubbed and capped. The depth, tier and fan-out limits are safety
defaults; draft AUTONOMOUS-10 is not an acceptance criterion and stays left
for HI capture.

Acceptance Criteria
- Only `[corvidinho.autonomous] enabled = true` (or the dotted key) turns autonomous mode on; string / number / inline-table / later-table values and a missing file are off; this repo's `fledge.toml` ships off.
- `buildOpenAiTools` omits `delegate` unless `autonomous: true`, and offers it at code tier only.
- `createTaskExecute` in a temp project with autonomous enabled at code tier offers `delegate`; a disabled project, tool tier, or depth 2 does not; a model call to a hidden `delegate` is refused, not run.
- A lead tool loop that calls `delegate` against a fake bin receives the worker summary in the tool message, and the worker's filesChanged join the lead's result.
- Depth parse fails closed; tier clamp never exceeds the lead; spawn argv uses `bun --no-env-file` with `--task` last and no `--no-verify` flag; forced worker env overrides inherited env; the limiter refuses past 2 concurrent / 4 per run.
- Worker timeout, lead abort, and a grandchild holding the pipe do not hang the lead; a `.env` in the cwd is not loaded by a `.ts` worker.
