# Delta — discord (auto-pause and pre-run failures ask the owner)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-353

A schedule SHALL NOT stop, or fail to start a run, silently (AUTONOMY-2:
"When stuck, it pings the configured owner on Discord rather than dying
silently"). Two schedule-run outcomes SHALL record a `stuck` ask on the
run's `schedule_runs` row, so the REQ-discord-347 ask post and delivery
pass ping the owner:

- Pre-run failure. A run whose project cannot be resolved (`project resolve
  failed: …`) or whose worktree cannot be created (`worktree failed: …`)
  SHALL still spawn no agent and be recorded failed with that full error,
  and SHALL record a stuck ask whose question is fixed text naming the step
  (`PROJECT_RESOLVE_FAILED_QUESTION`, `WORKTREE_FAILED_QUESTION`), never the
  host path or the error text (REQ-discord-418, SAFE-6), so a repeat of the
  same failure keeps one ping key.
- Auto-pause. The run whose failure makes `FAILURE_AUTO_PAUSE` (5) failures
  in a row, counted in SQL in the same run-finish transaction as today
  (REQ-discord-108), SHALL store the stuck `autoPauseAsk` in that same write
  instead of its own ask: `Paused after 5 failed runs in a row. Fix the
  cause, then resume it with /schedule resume.`, followed by a
  `Last failure: <question>` line when the run stopped with its own ask. The
  pause itself is unchanged (status `paused`, ping key cleared). A run that
  succeeds SHALL never store it.
- Delivery. A ticker that can post (the bridge) SHALL post such an ask of
  its own run at once through the in-process ask post of REQ-discord-347
  (live DISCORD-SCHEDULE-3 gate, compare-and-set take, schedule prefix, stuck
  headline, the owner mentioned, once per question per schedule through
  `askPingKey`); the pausing run's ask SHALL replace its plain `❌` post. An
  ask a ticker with no outbound (the daemon) recorded SHALL be posted by the
  bridge's next delivery pass. `ScheduleRunFinished.askReason` SHALL be
  `stuck` for these runs, so the daemon logs `run.needs_human`
  (REQ-cli-098).
- Gate. A run the DISCORD-SCHEDULE-3 gate refuses (REQ-discord-020) SHALL
  still record no ask of its own and post nothing; when refused runs
  auto-pause the schedule, the pause ask SHALL stay pending until the gate
  passes, like any pending ask.

No new slash command, env var, config key, table, column or schema version;
`/schedule resume` is the existing ADMIN subcommand.

Acceptance Criteria
- A daemon-claimed run that makes 5 failures in a row pauses the schedule and stores `ask_reason` `stuck` with the pause question and `ask_posted_at` null; `onRunFinished` reports `autoPaused: true` and `askReason: "stuck"`; the bridge's next tick posts it once with the schedule prefix, the stuck headline, the pause line, the `failed (exit 1)` context and `mentionUserIds` [owner]; the 4 earlier failures record no ask and post nothing.
- A stuck run that makes the 5th failure posts one ask: the pause line followed by `Last failure: <its question>`.
- A bridge-claimed run that makes the 5th failure posts the pause ask with the owner ping instead of the `❌` line (the 4 earlier ones post `❌` with no ping), records the ping key and is not posted again.
- Refused runs that auto-pause the schedule spawn no agent and post nothing; once the creator is allowed again the next tick posts the pause ask with the owner ping.
- A daemon run whose project cannot be resolved spawns no agent, keeps `project resolve failed: …` (with the host path) on the row and stores the fixed question; the bridge posts it with the owner ping and without the host path; the same failure again posts without a ping.
- A bridge run whose worktree cannot be created keeps `worktree failed: …` on the row and posts the fixed question at once with the owner ping, once.
- The pause ask is chosen by the failure count in SQL: a store handle whose cache is stale stores it when SQL reaches 5; a success stores no ask and resets the count.
