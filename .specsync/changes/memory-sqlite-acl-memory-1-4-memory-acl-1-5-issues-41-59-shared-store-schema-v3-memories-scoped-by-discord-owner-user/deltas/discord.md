# Delta — discord (MEMORY SQLite + ACL)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-021

Corvidinho SHALL persist conversations, entities, people, and personality notes
in the shared local SQLite database under `~/.local/share/corvidinho/` (schema
version **3**, table `memories`) so they survive process restart (MEMORY-1..4).
Memory SHALL stay local SQLite only — no on-chain, Trust, or Augur path
(MEMORY-3 / MEMORY-ACL-5).

Each memory row SHALL be scoped to `owner_user_id` (acting Discord user id).
Reads and writes SHALL default to that user’s scope only (MEMORY-ACL-1).

Forget, delete, overwrite, and re-attribute operations SHALL require ADMIN
permission re-checked at handler time (MEMORY-ACL-3/4, ADMIN-4, DISCORD-7),
including **self-forget** of one’s own memories. Empty admin/owner lists SHALL
deny-all for forget/override. A non-admin attempt against another user’s
memories SHALL be refused without leaking the other user’s content
(MEMORY-ACL-2). Soft-delete MAY retain audit fields (`deleted_at`,
`deleted_by_user_id`).

No Discord slash `/memory` SHALL be invented in this requirement — exposure is
via `MemoryStore` + memory plugins used by the agent/session path. Categories
SHALL be `conversation` | `entity` | `person` | `personality`. Fixture tests
without live Discord SHALL cover CRUD, reload, ACL deny, and admin forget.

Acceptance Criteria
- Schema migrates to v3 with `memories` table and owner/category indexes.
- Store + recall scoped to acting owner; four HI categories accepted.
- Reload after reopen DB returns prior rows (MEMORY-4).
- Non-admin cannot forget/override own or others; empty admin deny-all.
- Admin forget soft-deletes with audit fields; refuse path leaks no content.
- No on-chain memory; no new slash command; no ProcessManager.
- Bridge opens MemoryStore on shared DB; package version bumped for ship.
- Fixture tests + SpecSync + fledge verify green.

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-019

Discord `SessionStore` (and `WorkStore`) SHALL optionally persist to a local
SQLite database under the shared Corvidinho data directory
(`~/.local/share/corvidinho/` by default, overridable via `CORVIDINHO_DATA_DIR`)
so session and work stubs survive process restarts (SESSION durable substrate).
Cross-session continuity SHALL use the same shared SQLite file via MEMORY
tables (REQ-discord-021), not a long-lived ProcessManager.

Soft TTL SHALL default to about **45 minutes** (within SESSION-2's 30–60 minute
band), overridable via `CORVIDINHO_SESSION_TTL_MS` clamped to that band.
Continued activity (`touch` / continue paths) SHALL refresh `lastActivityAt`
(SESSION-2). Lookups for sessions idle past the TTL SHALL treat them as expired
and SHALL NOT continue them, so the next eligible mention starts a fresh
session (SESSION-1 / SESSION-3).

The bridge SHALL open the shared DB when starting (unless tests inject
in-memory stores). Schedules and memories MAY share the same SQLite file
(REQ-discord-020 / REQ-discord-021). Fixture tests SHALL cover persist/reload
and TTL expiry without a live Discord token.

Acceptance Criteria
- Session create + bot-message/thread maps reload from SQLite after reopen.
- Work task stubs reload from the same DB after reopen.
- Default TTL ~45m; env override clamped to 30–60m.
- Idle past TTL → getByThread/getByBotMessage/get/list omit or purge; continue path does not resume.
- Activity within TTL keeps continue_session.
- Data dir defaults to `~/.local/share/corvidinho/`; `CORVIDINHO_DATA_DIR` overrides.
- Memories share `corvidinho.db` (schema v3) without a second database.
- No ProcessManager; secrets out of repo; existing allowlists unchanged.
- Fixture tests pass without live Discord token.
