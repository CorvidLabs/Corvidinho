# Delta — watch (untrusted GitHub text; SAFE-12/13)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-watch-071

Untrusted GitHub text on WATCH (SAFE-12 / SAFE-13, #71). The event's title
and body (`watchEventText`) SHALL reach the model only inside an
`UNTRUSTED_DATA` fence (`source=github-thread`, header
`WATCH_BODY_FENCE_HEADER`) after the `[WATCH …]` header and `URL:` line, the
text clipped before fencing (and again by any overflow the fence adds) so the
whole prompt stays within `WATCH_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS` (8000) and the end marker
with its random id is always last. Before any ack or run the poller SHALL call
`watchInjectionVerdict(event, people)` for every routed event: null for the
owner (recognised by GitHub id / login in the owner's people list) and for
text that does not trip `detectInjection`; on a hit the event SHALL count
`refused`, run nothing and get no ack, one comment
(`buildInjectionRefusalBody`: what WATCH won't do and why in plain words,
never the text, @mentioning the owner's GitHub login from `[owner]` / env when
set) posted by `postWatchInjectionRefusal` for any event type (skipped for the
watch user's own events, an already-answered id and a bad repo; the id joins
the acked store; a rate-limited post backs off like an ack), one
`injection-suspected` / `denied` SAFE-5 row (actor `github:<login>`, surface
`watch:<session>`, digest of the source and reasons; best effort), a
`[watch] SAFE-13 refused …` log line and `onAction` kind
`injection_refused`; the event id is already processed, so it is never
retried. The WATCH spawn client SHALL read the child's `result.injection`
(`injectionNoticeFromUnknown`) into `AgentSpawnResult.injection`, and the
run-summary comment SHALL then add `watchInjectionLine` (@mentioning the
owner's login when set); when no summary comment is posted for that run (an
event type WATCH does not ack, such as an assignment or review request, or no
successful ack), `maybePostWatchInjectionNotice` SHALL post one comment
(`buildInjectionNoticeBody`: the same line and the attribution footer) once
per event id (the summary dedup store; skipped for a bad repo; a rate-limited
post backs off like the summary). No env var, config key, table or column.

Acceptance Criteria
- `routeEvent` puts the title and body inside the fence after the header; a 20 000-char body that guesses the end marker, and a body of lines that get quoted, both leave the real end marker last and the prompt within 8000 chars.
- `watchInjectionVerdict` flags a non-owner's injected body or title and returns null for the owner's and for an ordinary body.
- Through `startWatchPoller` with a memory DB and the echo ack client: an injected comment runs nothing, gets one comment @mentioning the owner's GitHub login and one `injection-suspected` row with actor `github:<login>`; the next ordinary event runs with its body fenced.
- `buildSummaryBody` adds the owner line only when the run reports `injection`.
- Through `startWatchPoller`: an assignment event whose run reports `injection` gets one comment @mentioning the owner's login with the SAFE-13 line, and a second poll does not repeat it.
- Regression tests in `tests/safe.injection.test.ts` fail on the base sources and pass after.

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-watch-036

WATCH SHALL recognise the owner and each declared person (IDENTITY-14,
REQ-discord-036) who triggers an event, by stable ids only (IDENTITY-7): the
commenter's GitHub numeric id (`DetectedEvent.senderId`, from the API's
`user.id` on search items and comments; the fixture search client reads
`user_id`) and login, through `resolvePerson`. `startWatchPoller` SHALL load
the owner (IDENTITY-1) from the allowlist file it loaded plus env, and pass
the declared people, re-read from that file for every routed event, to
`routeEvent` (`RouterDeps.people`), so edits apply without a restart. For a
resolved commenter the run prompt SHALL open with a separate paragraph headed
`[Corvidinho acting GitHub user …]` naming `github_login`, `declared_person`,
`display_name`, `nicknames` and, for the owner, `role: owner` (a GitHub run
still gets no ADMIN tools), before the `[WATCH …]` header; Planning ignores
that paragraph like the Discord identity block. Once anyone is declared, an
unresolved commenter SHALL get the block with `declared_person: none`; with
nobody declared (only the owner) and an unresolved commenter, or without
`people`, the prompt SHALL be exactly as before, apart from the SAFE-12 fence
around the title and body (REQ-watch-071). Allowlist gates, sessions,
acks and the spawn env (no Discord actor, non-ADMIN) are unchanged.

Acceptance Criteria
- A declared commenter's start prompt begins with the identity paragraph (`github_login`, `declared_person`, `display_name`, `nicknames`), then a blank line and `[WATCH issue_comment] …`; `planningSelectionText` drops it.
- A renamed login with the declared numeric id resolves; the declared login with a different numeric id does not (`declared_person: none`).
- The owner is recognised by the `[owner]` / env GitHub login with `role: owner`; a commenter whose login equals a declared display name is not that person.
- With nobody declared, or without `people`, an unresolved commenter's prompt starts with `[WATCH`.
- The fixture search client carries `user_id` to `senderId` on comment events.
- `startWatchPoller` with an allowlist file recognises a declared commenter, and a person added to the file after start is recognised on the next event.
- Regression tests in `tests/identity.recognise.test.ts` fail on the base sources and pass after.
- With nobody declared, an unresolved commenter's prompt still starts with `[WATCH`; the title and body follow inside the `UNTRUSTED_DATA` fence (REQ-watch-071, `tests/safe.injection.test.ts`).
