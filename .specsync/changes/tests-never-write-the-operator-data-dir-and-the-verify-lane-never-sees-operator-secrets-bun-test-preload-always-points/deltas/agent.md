# Delta — agent (verify lane never sees operator secrets)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-002

When `verify_before_complete` is enabled and the execute step reports files changed, completion SHALL run `fledge lanes run verify --non-interactive`. Pass → `verified=true`. Fail with retries remaining → re-enter executing with verifier output. Exhausted retries → terminal failure with `verified=false` (AGENT-4 / AGENT-4.a / FLEDGE-2). The default runner SHALL spawn fledge with the parent's env minus the delegate worker drop list (`DISCORD_*`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `CORVIDINHO_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` and every `CORVIDINHO_ACTING_*` key) and the LLM API keys (`CORVIDINHO_LLM_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`), keeping every other inherited key, so tests the agent wrote never see operator secrets (SAFE-6).

Acceptance Criteria
- Mock verify fail then pass within max_retries yields `verified=true` and a second execute call that receives feedback.
- Exhausted retries yield `verified=false` and failed state.
- Default runner invokes fledge with `lanes run verify --non-interactive`.
- A process with `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CORVIDINHO_LLM_API_KEY`, `CORVIDINHO_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` and `CORVIDINHO_ACTING_*` set runs the default runner: the fledge child's env has none of those keys or values and keeps the rest (PATH, HOME, `CORVIDINHO_DATA_DIR`, other keys).
