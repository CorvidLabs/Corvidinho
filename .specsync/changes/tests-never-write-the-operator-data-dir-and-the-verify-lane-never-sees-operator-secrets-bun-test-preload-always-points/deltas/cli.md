# Delta — cli (bun test never writes the operator's data dir)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-cli-262

The test suite SHALL NOT write the operator's Corvidinho state (SAFE-5). The
bun test preload (`tests/preload.ts`, loaded by `bunfig.toml`) SHALL always
point `CORVIDINHO_DATA_DIR` at its own temporary directory, overriding an
inherited value, and SHALL unset `CORVIDINHO_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`,
`CORVIDINHO_WATCH_SPAWN_LOG` and `WORKTREE_BASE_DIR`, so a suite run with the
operator's env (including the prove-before-done verify lane spawned from
Discord, WATCH, the daemon or `task run`) never adds audit rows, sessions or
memory to the operator's DB and never signs a test audit row with the
operator's key. A process a test spawns with `Bun.spawn` / `Bun.spawnSync` and
no explicit `env` SHALL get the preload's env, not the environment the test
process started with. The preload SHALL also unset the run and operator
settings that change test outcomes on the bot box, so the suite runs as it
does on CI: `CORVIDINHO_NON_INTERACTIVE` and `FLEDGE_NON_INTERACTIVE` (every
Discord, WATCH and daemon task run sets the first, and its verify lane runs
the suite), `CORVIDINHO_DAILY_SPEND_CAP_USD`, and the LLM API keys
`CORVIDINHO_LLM_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` (so `bun test` never sends a real
model call). No new env var, config key or command.

Acceptance Criteria
- With the operator's `CORVIDINHO_DATA_DIR`, `CORVIDINHO_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`, `CORVIDINHO_WATCH_SPAWN_LOG` and `WORKTREE_BASE_DIR` set, a child `bun test` writes 0 audit rows (and no file) to the operator data dir; its rows, including a CLI run it spawns, land in the preload's temp dir.
- An operator DB that already holds an audit chain keeps the same row count and last hash after the child run, and no test row is keyed with the operator's key.
- A CLI or shell a test spawns without an explicit `env` (`Bun.spawn(argv)`, `Bun.spawn({ cmd })`, `Bun.spawnSync(argv)`) resolves the preload's data dir and sees no audit key, WATCH spawn log or worktree base override.
- Full `bun test` with those operator vars set passes and leaves the operator data dir empty.
- With `CORVIDINHO_NON_INTERACTIVE`, `FLEDGE_NON_INTERACTIVE`, `CORVIDINHO_DAILY_SPEND_CAP_USD`, `CORVIDINHO_LLM_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` set, a child `bun test` sees none of them: it is not non-interactive and has no LLM API key; full `bun test` with them set passes.
