# Delta — agent (council core, #118)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-118

A council SHALL deliberate in structured phases when a decision needs more
than one voice (AUTONOMOUS-6). `runCouncil` (`src/autonomous/council.ts`)
SHALL run, in order: **propose**, where each of N voices (2..5) answers the
question independently; **critique**, where each voice whose proposal
finished sees every finished proposal (its own marked as its own) and
critiques the others; and **decide**, where one chair run synthesizes a
decision from the finished proposals and critiques. When fewer than 2 voices
finish the propose phase, no critique or decide run SHALL start and the
outcome SHALL be failed. Failed critiques SHALL NOT block the decide phase.
When the chair does not finish, the outcome SHALL be failed with an empty
decision.

Every voice and the chair SHALL run through the delegation core
(`runDelegateChild`, REQ-agent-117) one level deeper than the lead, so each
keeps its argv, worker env stripping, timeout / abort / exit cleanup and
scrubbed summary. Voices SHALL run at the `read` tier by default, never above
`tool` and never above the lead's tier (an unknown tier is refused). They
SHALL run as non-ADMIN role sessions (`CORVIDINHO_ACTING_IS_ADMIN=0`), so
mutating tools are absent and refused (ROLES-CHAT-2/3), and SHALL get an
empty SAFE-1 allowlist, so a must-ask tool is always denied. At most 2 voices
(`MAX_CONCURRENT_DELEGATES`) SHALL run at once. Each phase entry SHALL be
SAFE-6 scrubbed and capped (1500 chars per voice entry, `DELEGATE_SUMMARY_MAX`
for the decision). Later phases SHALL see only capped text, quoted as data
and not as instructions. A finished run SHALL be quoted by the worker's own
result summary (`DelegateChildOutcome.resultText`, capped at
`DELEGATE_SUMMARY_MAX` rather than the 1800-char chat body).
Each run SHALL get a per-voice time cap (5 min) no larger than the time left.
The whole council SHALL have a wall-clock cap (15 min). When the cap is
reached or the lead aborts, running voices SHALL be stopped, no later phase
SHALL start, and the outcome SHALL be cancelled. The outcome SHALL carry the
decision, the transcript (phase, speaker, lens, ok, state, exit code, text),
per-phase tallies, the union of voice filesChanged, summed tokens, elapsed
time and timeout / abort flags. The voice tier, caps and lenses are safety
defaults. Draft AUTONOMOUS-11 (a multi-model council with a confidence
score) is not an acceptance criterion: voices use the lead's provider and the
council returns no confidence score.

Acceptance Criteria
- With 3 voices the runs go propose 1..3, critique 1..3, then decide, never more than 2 at once. Critique prompts contain every finished proposal, the decide prompt contains every finished proposal and critique, and the outcome is done with the chair's text as the decision.
- A failed proposal drops that voice from critique. Fewer than 2 finished proposals ends the council failed with no critique or decide. Failed critiques still reach the chair. A failed chair gives ok=false and an empty decision. A runner that throws is a failed entry.
- Entries and the decision are scrubbed and capped. The per-voice timeout never exceeds the voice cap or the time left. The council time cap and a lead abort stop running voices, skip later phases and give state cancelled.
- The voice tier defaults to read, `code` is clamped to tool, a read lead clamps to read, and an unknown tier is refused.
- The tool loop offers `council` only for an autonomous-enabled project at code tier below the depth cap, and a lead that calls it gets the decision in the tool message.
