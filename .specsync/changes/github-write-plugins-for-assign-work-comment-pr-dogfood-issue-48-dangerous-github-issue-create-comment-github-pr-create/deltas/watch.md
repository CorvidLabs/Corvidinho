# Delta — watch (assignment ingress #48)

## Modified

### SPEC SECTION Purpose

Thin GitHub WATCH poll ingress: Octokit/fixture search → allowlist gate →
session stub for mention / issue_comment / review_request / assignment on
allowlisted targets (ALLOW-1). Assignment when watch username is in issue/PR
assignees (#48). Poll-first for bot/VM; webhook deferred.

### SPEC SECTION Behavioral Examples

Allowlisted mention or assignment→start_session; same repo#number→continue_session;
non-allowlisted user/repo→refuse quiet; duplicate id→skip; missing token /
empty repos refuse start cleanly.

### SPEC SECTION Change Log

WATCH poll-first thin (#19, 2026-09-26, corvid-agent): mention/review_request/issue_comment → allowlist → session stub; webhook deferred.
