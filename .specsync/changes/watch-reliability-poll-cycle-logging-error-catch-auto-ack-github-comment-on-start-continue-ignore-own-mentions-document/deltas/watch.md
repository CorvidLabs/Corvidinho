# Delta — watch (reliability / flake harden)

## Modified

### SPEC SECTION Purpose

Thin GitHub WATCH poll ingress: Octokit/fixture search → allowlist gate →
session stub for mention / issue_comment / review_request / assignment on
allowlisted targets (ALLOW-1). Assignment when watch username is in issue/PR
assignees (#48). Poll-first for bot/VM; webhook deferred. Reliability harden:
per-cycle poll logging, caught pollOnce errors, auto-ack GitHub comment on
mention/comment start/continue (skip own username; once per event id), ignore
own mentions in search, document org-search pagination bury risk.

### SPEC SECTION Public API

loadWatchConfig, startWatchPoller, routeEvent, SessionStore, goLiveChecklist,
NOT_AUTHORIZED, filterNewEvents, containsMention, DetectedEvent types,
agent helpers, createFixtureSearchClient / createOctokitSearchClient,
ack helpers (shouldAckEvent, buildAckBody, AckClient, AckedIdStore).

### SPEC SECTION Invariants

Empty github orgs+repos fail-start; empty users = deny-all for triggers;
allowlist BEFORE session spawn; denied refuse quietly (no session); processed-id
dedup; no ProcessManager; no auto-merge; secrets out of repo; fixture tests
need no live webhook secrets; pollOnce errors logged not swallowed; own
watch-username comments/mentions skipped; auto-ack at most once per event id.

### SPEC SECTION Behavioral Examples

Allowlisted mention or assignment→start_session; same repo#number→continue_session;
non-allowlisted user/repo→refuse quiet; duplicate id→skip; missing token /
empty repos refuse start cleanly; poll cycle logs six counters; mention/comment
start/continue posts ack unless sender is watch username or already acked;
own-username comment omitted from events.

### SPEC SECTION Change Log

| 2026-09-26 | watch-reliability-poll-cycle-logging-error-catch-auto-ack-github-comment-on-start-continue-ignore-own-mentions-document: poll logging + error catch, auto-ack, ignore own mentions, pagination bury docs (REQ-watch-007) |

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-watch-007

WATCH poll cycles SHALL log `fetched`, `new`, `started`, `continued`, `refused`,
and `skipped` counts each cycle. Errors from `pollOnce` SHALL be caught and
logged (not swallowed by fire-and-forget `void`). When the poller starts or
continues a session from an `issue_comment` or `issues` mention event whose
sender is not the watch username, it SHALL post a short GitHub issue comment
ack (with Made with Corvidinho attribution) at most once per event id.
`fetchWatchEvents` SHALL skip comments and issue-body mentions authored by the
watch username. Org/repo search MAY use `per_page` up to 100; docs SHALL note
that results beyond one page can bury non-primary-repo pings.

Acceptance Criteria
- Every successful poll cycle emits a log line with the six counters.
- Interval/immediate poll wrappers attach `.catch` and log failures.
- Ack skipped when sender === mentionUsername or event already acked.
- Ack only for issue_comment / issues on start_session / continue_session.
- Own-username comments/mentions absent from fetched events (fixture).
- docs/WATCH.md documents pagination bury risk; fixture tests need no live token.
