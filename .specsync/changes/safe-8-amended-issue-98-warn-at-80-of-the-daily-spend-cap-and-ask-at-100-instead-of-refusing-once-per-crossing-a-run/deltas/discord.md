# Delta — discord (spend-cap ask, 80% warning delivery, /status spend, issue #98)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-098

The shared SQLite store SHALL treat the module-owned `spend_ledger` and
`spend_alerts` tables (created by `src/agent/spend.ts` and
`src/agent/spend-alerts.ts` with CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, no schema
version bump) like every other persisted table under SAFE-6: the free-text
`provider` and `model` columns of `spend_ledger` SHALL be written through
`scrubSecrets` and SHALL be listed in `SCRUB_TARGETS`, so a scrub-rules
re-scrub also covers them; `spend_alerts` SHALL hold no free text.

On Discord (SAFE-8 as amended on #98, AUTONOMOUS-8), a run that stopped at
the spend cap (`ask.reason` `spend-cap`) SHALL be posted through the
AUTONOMY-1/2 ask path on every bridge surface — chat reply, `/work`,
`/session start` and schedule post — with a paused, not failed, status and
without the "reply to answer" hint (a reply cannot lift the cap). The
configured owner SHALL be pinged once per cap episode across those surfaces
(the bridge's spend alert outbox `claimCapPing`; a schedule also keeps its
per-schedule ping key); later spend-cap asks in the same episode SHALL post
without a ping. `/work` SHALL record a run that stopped to ask as `blocked`
(not `completed`; a stuck run stays `failed`), SHALL say the PR was not
opened because the run paused at the spend cap, and `/status` SHALL count
blocked work as waiting for input. A slash run's owner ping and warning
SHALL go out as a fresh channel post after the reply (allowed mentions
limited to the owner), or be appended to the reply when that post cannot be
sent.

The 80% warning SHALL reach the owner even when the run that crossed it had
no Discord reply (WATCH, the headless daemon, a delegate worker, a schedule
whose channel left the allowlist): every bridge post SHALL take the pending
warning from the outbox over the bridge's shared DB (the run's own
`spendWarning`, validated by `spendWarningFromUnknown`, only when the bridge
has no DB) and append the warning line built from integer amounts, pinging
the configured owner; a failed chat reply or schedule post SHALL hand the
warning back. `/status` SHALL show the rolling 24-hour spend against the cap
with the percent, or that no cap is set, from the bridge's shared DB, with
no new slash command.

Acceptance Criteria
- A ledger row written with a vendor-key-looking provider or model persists redacted.
- `SCRUB_TARGETS` contains `spend_ledger` with `provider` and `model`.
- `rescrubDatabase` re-scrubs a raw `spend_ledger` row.
- A `spend-cap` ask reply carries the spend-cap headline and the question, pings the owner, its thinking status is not an error, and it never carries the reply hint.
- Two spend-cap asks with different amounts share one `askPingKey`.
- Two chat messages at the cap: the first reply pings the owner, the second posts the ask with no mention; after spend is seen under 70% the next one pings again.
- `/work` at the cap: the task is `blocked`, the reply shows the ask and the spend-cap PR line (no ✅), and one fresh post pings the owner; a second `/work` in the same episode does not ping. `/session start` at the cap shows the ask and pings the owner.
- A schedule spend-cap ask in an episode already pinged elsewhere posts without a mention.
- A warning recorded by another process (a WATCH-style run on the same data dir) appears on the next bridge chat reply with the owner pinged, once; `/work` delivers a pending warning as a fresh post pinging the owner.
- A result with `spendWarning` and no bridge DB gets the warning line and the owner in `mentionUserIds` (chat reply and schedule post); a malformed `spendWarning` in the result frame is dropped.
- `/status` with a $5 cap and $4.10 spent shows `Spend (24h): $4.10 of $5.00 daily cap (82%)`.
