# Delta — discord (memory acting env hygiene)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-021

Corvidinho SHALL persist conversations, entities, people, and personality notes
in the shared local SQLite database under `~/.local/share/corvidinho/` (schema
version **3**, table `memories`) so they survive process restart (MEMORY-1..4).
Memory SHALL stay local SQLite only — no on-chain, Trust, or Augur path
(MEMORY-3 / MEMORY-ACL-5).

Each memory row SHALL be scoped to `owner_user_id` (acting Discord user id).
Reads and writes SHALL default to that user’s scope only (MEMORY-ACL-1).

Forget, delete, overwrite, and re-attribute operations SHALL require ADMIN
permission re-checked at handler time (MEMORY-ACL-3/4, ADMIN-4, DISCORD-7),
including **self-forget** of one’s own memories. Empty admin/owner lists SHALL
deny-all for forget/override. A non-admin attempt against another user’s
memories SHALL be refused without leaking the other user’s content
(MEMORY-ACL-2). Soft-delete MAY retain audit fields (`deleted_at`,
`deleted_by_user_id`).

The Discord agent spawn SHALL always overwrite `CORVIDINHO_ACTING_DISCORD_USER_ID`
(empty when the run has no acting user) and `CORVIDINHO_ACTING_IS_ADMIN`, so a
value in the bridge's own environment never leaks into a spawned run. Memory
plugins SHALL read identity only from that env, never from argv
(REQ-plugins-011).

No Discord slash `/memory` SHALL be invented in this requirement — exposure is
via `MemoryStore` + memory plugins used by the agent/session path. Categories
SHALL be `conversation` | `entity` | `person` | `personality`. Fixture tests
without live Discord SHALL cover CRUD, reload, ACL deny, and admin forget.

Acceptance Criteria
- Memory CRUD, reload after reopen, ACL deny, and admin forget covered by fixtures.
- Discord spawn env carries the dispatching actor, or an empty actor, never an inherited one.
- No `/memory` slash; no on-chain path.
