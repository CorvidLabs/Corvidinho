# Delta — discord (slash asks with listable options use the Choose stub)

## Modified

### REQUIREMENT REQ-discord-044

Sessions SHALL persist `pendingAsk` (including askId / expiresAt / optional
options). While set, a thin-ack continue SHALL restate the ask (stub+Choose
when options; formatAskReply when free-text) and SHALL NOT spawn the agent.
An explicit cancel SHALL clear pending ask. For free-text pending (no
options), a substantive continue SHALL clear pending and run the agent with
prior-question context. For button pending (has options), ordinary chat SHALL
continue the conversation WITHOUT clearing pending; only button pick, cancel,
or expiry SHALL clear it. Clarify asks SHALL mention the requester; stuck
asks SHALL mention the configured owner.

A `/work` or `/session start` run that stopped with a clarify or stuck ask
SHALL store that ask as its session's pending ask, and `/work` SHALL record
the task `blocked` (a stuck ask stays `failed`), never `completed`
(AUTONOMY-1). When the ask's choices fit a short list (ask-human `options`,
else a numbered list parsed from the question, as in REQ-discord-045), the
slash answer SHALL be the public Choose stub with its Choose button, as in
chat (DISCORD-ASK-1/4): the stub SHALL NOT show the question or the options
(DISCORD-ASK-2), the stored pending ask SHALL keep the options and the answer
message id as its stub, and the requester's Choose press and pick SHALL
resume that session in the stub (DISCORD-ASK-3). The Choose button SHALL stay
on the answer when the owner notice has to be appended to it. When the
options cannot be listed, the pending ask SHALL be free text and the slash
answer SHALL show the question as text (DISCORD-ASK-4). The slash answer
message SHALL be bound to its session like a chat reply (DISCORD-2), so a
reply to it by the requester continues that session and the rules above apply
(AUTONOMY-5/6). A SAFE-8 spend-cap stop SHALL NOT be stored as the pending
ask and SHALL NOT get Choose buttons.

Acceptance Criteria
- Clarify mentionUserIds is [requester] when provided; stuck is [owner].
- Thin ack restates; pendingAsk remains.
- Cancel clears pendingAsk.
- Free-text substantive continue clears pending and runs agent.
- Button pending survives unrelated chat turns until pick/cancel/expiry.
- `/work` with a clarify ask whose options cannot be listed: the task is `blocked`, the session's pending ask is the free-text clarify ask, and the collapsed answer message maps to that session.
- A thin reply (`ok`) to a free-text `/work` answer restates the question (requester mention, reply hint) and does not run the agent; the pending ask remains.
- `cancel` in reply to the `/work` answer clears the pending ask with the short ack and does not run the agent.
- A substantive reply to a free-text `/work` answer resumes the same session (`resume: true`) with the prior question and the human answer in the prompt, and clears the pending ask.
- `/work` or `/session start` stopped at the spend cap stores no pending ask; a later `ok` to the `/work` answer runs the agent with no prior-question or cap text.
- `/session start` with a clarify ask: the pending ask is stored; a thin reply restates, a substantive reply resumes with the question.
- `/session start` with a clarify ask that has a single structured option (not a list): the pending ask is free text (no options), so a substantive reply answers and clears it.
- `/work` with a stuck ask: the task is `failed`, the pending ask is stored; the owner is pinged once by the separate notice post (the answer itself pings nobody), and a thin reply restates the question with allowed mentions limited to the owner (never the requester).
- A reply to the `/work` answer by another user (`ok`, `cancel` or a substantive answer) neither runs the agent nor clears or restates the requester's pending ask (SESSION-MULTI-1).
- A finished `/work` run (`completed`) stores no pending ask and its answer still continues the session.
- Without an editable thinking message the pending ask is still stored, and an @mention `ok` from the requester restates it without running the agent.
- `/work` with a clarify ask that has structured options: the task is `blocked`; the collapsed answer is the Choose stub (requester mention and the Choose hint; no question, options or reply hint) with one Choose button, followed by the one requester ping post; the pending ask keeps the options with the answer message id as `stubMessageId`; the requester's Choose press opens the ephemeral question with the option buttons, and a pick resumes the same session (`resume: true`, the chosen label) with the answer edited into the stub.
- `/session start` with a numbered list in the question: the answer is the Choose stub, the pending ask holds the parsed options, and a pick resumes the same session.
- A thin reply to a slash Choose stub restates the stub with its Choose button without running the agent; a substantive reply continues the session and the button ask stays pending.
- `/work` with a stuck ask that has options: the task is `failed`, the Choose stub pings nobody and the owner is told by the separate notice post; when that post fails, the notice is appended to the stub and the Choose button stays.
- Without an editable thinking message, the deferred reply carries the Choose stub and its button, and its message id is the pending ask's `stubMessageId`.
- A spend-cap stop never becomes a button ask, even with options.
