# Delta — agent (tool loop sends files-read images as image parts, DISCORD-9)

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-428

When a tool-loop round's tool results carry an image (`PluginHandlerResult.image`,
`files-read` REQ-plugins-427), the tool loop (REQ-agent-008) SHALL, after it
has pushed all of that round's tool messages, add one user message whose
content is a text part `Image(s) opened with files-read: <paths>` followed by
one `image_url` part per image with a `data:<mime>;base64,<bytes>` URL, so the
model sees the pixels (DISCORD-9). The tool message and the `ToolResult` event
detail SHALL keep only the metadata; the base64 SHALL NOT appear in tool text,
events or ndjson. If a chat/completions request that carries image parts gets
HTTP 400 (a model without vision), the loop SHALL replace every image part
with the text `[image <path> could not be shown to this model]`, emit an
`[operator]` Text note and retry that request once; later images in the same
run SHALL be sent as that text note. A 400 on the retry, or on a request with
no image parts, SHALL stay a provider error (REQ-agent-242). No new env var,
flag or protocol field.

Acceptance Criteria
- Mock HTTP: round 1 `files-read` of a PNG; the round 2 body has the small tool message (no base64) directly followed by the user message `[text, image_url(data:image/png;base64,…)]`; the round 1 body has no image part.
- Two images in one round ride one user message after both tool messages, with two `image_url` parts.
- The `ToolResult` detail and the run's ndjson lines never contain the base64.
- HTTP 400 on the image request: one retry carrying the text note and no base64; the run completes with the model's reply and no error flag.
- After that refusal, a later image in the run goes as the text note with no second retry.
- 400 again on the retry → error flag with `LLM HTTP 400`; 400 with no image sent → error, no retry.
- Fixture: `tests/agent.tool-loop.test.ts`, no live provider.
