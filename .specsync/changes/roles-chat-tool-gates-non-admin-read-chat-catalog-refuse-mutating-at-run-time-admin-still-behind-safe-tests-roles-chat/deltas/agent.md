# Delta — agent (ROLES-CHAT catalog filter)

## Modified

### SPEC SECTION Invariants

Tool-loop system prompt SHALL include trust-inject / memory-store /
memory-recall-before-ignorance / never-invent rules. OpenAI tool argv
descriptions for `memory-*` commands SHALL include concrete examples.

NDJSON frames never carry raw tool arguments; ToolCall `argsSummary`, Text,
ToolResult detail and VerifyResult output are SAFE-6 scrubbed and capped.
AgentEvent stays frozen (usage is a separate callback), so `task run --json`
events are unchanged.

Project instructions come only from the project root (nearest `.git` at or
above cwd, else cwd), never from a parent directory above it. Each file is
capped at 16 KiB with a truncation marker, SAFE-6 scrubbed, and labelled as
project instructions that cannot widen SAFE-1 consent, the tool allowlist or
the capability tier. The loader never throws.


`buildOpenAiTools` omits mutating plugins when `actingIsAdmin` is false (ROLES-CHAT-2); `createTaskExecute` resolves ADMIN from env via `resolveActingIsAdmin` when a role session is active.

### SPEC SECTION Change Log

Flesh LLM tool loop MVP on prove-before-done (#31) (2026-09-26, corvid-agent).
| 2026-09-26 | flesh-full-llm-tool-loop-on-prove-before-done-so-task-run-discord-watch-can-call-allowlisted-plugins-via-openai: Flesh full LLM tool loop on prove-before-done so task run / Discord / WATCH can call allowlisted plugins via OpenAI-compatible tools (issue #31 dogfood MVP) |
| 2026-09-26 | memory-discord-inject: MEMORY system prompt + tool argv (REQ-agent-010) |
| 2026-09-26 | discord-memory-auto-recall-inject-on-spawn-plus-system-prompt-store-recall-rules-agent-7-memory-2-4-draft-67-behavior: Discord MEMORY auto-recall inject on spawn plus system-prompt store/recall rules (AGENT-7 MEMORY-2/4 draft #67 behavior) package 0.0.7 |
| 2026-09-26 | tool-loop-dispatches-only-tools-offered-in-the-run-s-catalog-safe-1-agent-5-pr-128-review-follow-up-a-registered-but: Tool loop dispatches only tools offered in the run's catalog (SAFE-1 / AGENT-5, PR #128 review follow-up): a registered but not-offered (e.g. dangerous or above-tier) plugin name from the model is refused instead of run; memory store test updated for soft-deleted re-store history |
| 2026-09-26 | spawned-agents-ignore-the-project-env-and-tests-never-create-real-worktrees-allow-4-safe-1-session-worktree-3-hygiene: Spawned agents ignore the project .env and tests never create real worktrees (ALLOW-4 / SAFE-1 / SESSION-WORKTREE-3 hygiene): bun-invoked spawns pass --no-env-file so a project worktree's .env cannot inject allowlists, admin lists or keys into the agent; bridge and slash fixture tests use temp project roots so bun test never adds talk/* worktrees or branches to the repo |
| 2026-09-26 | live-ndjson-event-stream-for-bridges-issue-73-agent-8-cli-7-discord-3-discord-10-task-run-output-ndjson-emits-one: Live NDJSON event stream for bridges (issue #73, AGENT-8 / CLI-7 / DISCORD-3 / DISCORD-10): task run --output ndjson emits one versioned JSON object per line for StateChanged/Text/ToolCall(redacted argument summary)/ToolResult/VerifyResult, running token usage, and a final result line; Discord and WATCH spawn clients consume the stream and forward state/tool/tokens to onStatus; protocol version 1 to 2 |
| 2026-09-26 | task-run-reads-the-project-s-own-agents-md-and-claude-md-from-the-project-root-into-the-llm-system-prompt-as-labelled: Task run reads the project's own AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md from the project root into the LLM system prompt as labelled project instructions (AGENT-1, issue #84 captured slice): 16 KiB cap with truncation marker, symlinks outside the project refused, binary/non-UTF-8 refused, SAFE-6 scrubbed |
| 2026-09-26 | roles-chat-tool-gates-non-admin-read-chat-catalog-refuse-mutating-at-run-time-admin-still-behind-safe-tests-roles-chat: ROLES-CHAT-2 catalog omit mutating for non-ADMIN |

## Added

### REQUIREMENT REQ-agent-roles-001

When building the tool catalog for an acting session, non-ADMIN SHALL not
receive mutating tools (including files-write/edit).

Acceptance Criteria
- `tests/roles.chat.gates.test.ts` catalog assertions for non-admin vs admin.
